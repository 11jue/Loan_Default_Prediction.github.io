## Description

Personal loans are indispensable for the daily life of many people nowadays. And distinguishing whether a client could fully pay their loan on time is the top-drawer question for lending banks. The objectives of our project are to use machine learning models to predict whether the loan could be fully paid on time or not and explore important features that might be useful for future loan decisions. Our dataset contains the accepted loans between 2007 to 2018 from LendingClub website, with data size of 150 columns and 2 million rows. 150 columns contain 1 predicting variable, loan_status, and 149 relevant variables, such as loan amount, term, interest rate, grade, etc.
